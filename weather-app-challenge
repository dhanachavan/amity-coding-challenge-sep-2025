 🚀 GitHub Copilot Coding Challenge: "Emoji Weather Wizard"

Welcome to the **Emoji Weather Wizard** challenge! 🌦️🧙‍♂️

Your mission is to build a fun and interactive **weather emoji generator** using GitHub Copilot. This challenge is designed to help you explore **advanced Copilot features** like:
- Multi-line code suggestions
- Natural language prompts
- Copilot Chat for debugging and refactoring
- Copilot Labs for code explanation and transformation

⏱️ **Time Limit**: 25 minutes  
👩‍💻 **Level**: Advanced  
🎯 **Goal**: Use Copilot to build a Python script that takes a city name and returns a weather emoji based on mock weather data.

🧩 Challenge Requirements
1. Setup

Create a new GitHub repo named emoji-weather-wizard
Add a single Python file: weather.py
Add a README.md with a short description of your project
2. Functionality
Use GitHub Copilot to help you:

Create a dictionary of mock weather data for 5 cities (e.g., Pune, Tokyo, London, NYC, Sydney)
Map weather conditions to emojis:
weather_emojis = {
      "sunny": "☀️",
      "rainy": "🌧️",
      "cloudy": "☁️",
      "stormy": "⛈️",
      "snowy": "❄️"
  }



Write a function get_weather_emoji(city) that returns the emoji for the city's weather
Add error handling for unknown cities
3. Bonus (Optional)
Use Copilot Chat to:

Refactor your code to use classes
Add a CLI interface using argparse
Add unit tests using unittest


🧠 Tips for Using GitHub Copilot

Start with comments like # Create a dictionary of mock weather data
Use Copilot Chat to ask: "Can you refactor this into a class?"
Try Copilot Labs to explain your code or convert it to another language


✅ Submission Checklist

Repo created and pushed to GitHub
weather.py contains working code
README.md explains the project
Used GitHub Copilot features (mention in README)


🎉 Have Fun!
Make it colorful, make it clever, and let Copilot be your coding sidekick! 🤖✨
